wavs/IDCMB02A.wav|Velasco.
wavs/IDCMB02B.wav|It looks like I've got one of your boys down here in the morgue.
wavs/IDCMB02C.wav|A sailor by the name of
wavs/IDCMB02D.wav|Naranja.
wavs/IDCMB05A.wav|All day long, Manny, I sort through pure sadness.
wavs/IDCMB05B.wav|I find evidence, and I piece together stories.
wavs/IDCMB05C.wav|But none of my stories end well -- they all end here.
wavs/IDCMB05D.wav|And the moral of every story is the same:
wavs/IDCMB05E.wav|We may have years, we may have hours,
wavs/IDCMB05F.wav|but sooner or later, we push up flowers.
wavs/MGME003.wav|Death makes sad stories of us all.
wavs/MGME005.wav|Booming, unfortunately.
wavs/MGME006.wav|More crime every day, and more and more sproutings like these.
wavs/MGME007.wav|Something's happening back in El Marrow, I think, and its dark hand is finally reaching us here in Rubacava.
wavs/MGME009.wav|I'm digging for a treasure that part of me does not wish to find...
wavs/MGME010.wav|For when I uncover that sad doubloon that tells me who this poor soul is...
wavs/MGME011.wav|...my reward is not riches, but the chance to make a phone call, and break somebody's heart.
wavs/MGME012.wav|Thanks for the metal detector, by the way.
wavs/MGME013.wav|Of course, with this equipment, the search could go on for some time.
wavs/MGME015.wav|Sure, grab hold of this leaf right here...
wavs/MGME016.wav|...Manny?
wavs/MGME018.wav|I know, I was just testing.
wavs/MGME020.wav|Without becoming jaded, you mean?
wavs/MGME021.wav|My secret to happiness, Manuel, is that I have the heart of a twelve-year-old boy.
wavs/MGME022.wav|I keep it over here in a jar. Would you like to see it?
wavs/MGME024.wav|Sorry. Old coroner joke.
wavs/MGME026.wav|Well, forensic botany is a trying job, Manny, but have you ever spent much time here with a florist?
wavs/MGME027.wav|In life, they became florists because they loved flowers, but here...
wavs/MGME028.wav|...a flower is a symbol of pain, of death within death.
wavs/MGME029.wav|Their conflicted feelings build and build, and eventually they become quite mad.
wavs/MGME034.wav|Manny, you can only search for something for so many years...
wavs/MGME035.wav|...before you stop believing in it altogether.
wavs/MGME037.wav|Why do you think we're all here in Rubacava?
wavs/MGME039.wav|Manny, we've given up. All of us.
wavs/MGME040.wav|When you've been here long enough, you will, too.
wavs/MGME042.wav|Always nice to have visitors.
wavs/MGME045.wav|You know I can't sleep with John Does on the slab, Manny.
wavs/MGME046.wav|If I don't ID these rose gardens tonight, I won't be ready for the two that come in tomorrow, and before you know it...
wavs/MGME047.wav|...I'm up to my ass in azaleas.
wavs/MGME050.wav|I know it's a poor coroner who blames his tools, Manny...
wavs/MGME051.wav|...but how am I supposed to turn up anything with the equipment they give me?
wavs/MGME055.wav|Then take my advice--buy an ID bracelet and wear it, always.
wavs/MGME060.wav|Look, Manuel, these old eyes are tired...
wavs/MGME061.wav|I'm doing the best I can, but the average retirement-age beachcomber has more sophisticated equipment than I've got here!
wavs/MGME066.wav|Hey, just like downtown!
wavs/MGME067.wav|You never know what this'll turn up!
wavs/MGME068.wav|An engraved ring... a belt buckle with somebody's name on it...
wavs/MGME072.wav|Only until I finish up here.
wavs/MGME074.wav|No, I'm trying to air it out.
